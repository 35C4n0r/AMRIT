#  title: Bridging Healthcare Gaps in Rural India
  content: In India’s rural and remote areas, healthcare service delivery faces significant challenges related to accessibility, affordability, and quality. These regions often struggle with a shortage of healthcare professionals and inadequate infrastructure, limiting access to specialized care. Patients frequently endure long travel distances to reach healthcare facilities, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment, especially for chronic conditions, maternal health, and communicable diseases. The financial burden of traveling outside their locality further restricts access, making healthcare less attainable for these populations.
